This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Chinese language creative writing project called "GPT Story Maker" - a light novel/web novel with a complex multi-dimensional storyline. The protagonist Lin Wanwan is a medical student who transmigrates into a cultivation world and develops the ability to summon multiple versions of herself from parallel realities through quantum superposition states.

## Story Architecture

**Core Concept**: Quantum superposition mechanics where the protagonist exists in multiple states simultaneously, manifesting as up to 42 different personalities/versions of herself.

**Key Elements**:
- Multi-dimensional personality system based on quantum mechanics
- Cultivation world setting with modern scientific knowledge integration
- Progressive power system tied to cultivation realms (Qi Refinement → Foundation Building → Golden Core → Nascent Soul)
- Philosophical themes around identity, choice, and the nature of existence
- The number "42" as a central motif (reference to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)

## Core Characters

- **Lin Wanwan (Original)**: Medical student protagonist with social anxiety and hoarding tendencies
- **Personality #1**: Yandere version from dating sim world
- **Personality #2**: Foodie version from culinary world  
- **Personality #7**: Mathematician version focused on calculations
- **Personality #21**: 5-year-old child version representing innocence
- **Personality #35**: Lawyer version focused on justice
- **Personality #42**: The "Answer Keeper" who knows ultimate truths but speaks in riddles
- **System 009**: Malfunctioning cultivation system with multiple personality disorder
- **The Unifier (Chen Yi)**: Main antagonist who seeks to eliminate all possibilities except one

## Writing Guidelines

**Language**: All content is in Chinese (Simplified)
**Genre**: Light novel/web novel with elements of:
- Xianxia (Cultivation fiction)
- Comedy/slice of life
- Science fiction concepts
- Philosophical exploration
- Action/adventure

**Tone**: Balances humor with deeper philosophical themes. Contains both lighthearted personality interactions and serious existential questions.

## Document Hierarchy and Management

**Authority Structure**:
- **设定/大纲.md** is the master document - all other files must align with this
- **设定/人格图鉴.md** uses flexible management: core personalities defined, others kept as "unlit possibilities"
- **设定/伏笔追踪表.md** tracks plot threads across all story arcs
- **Part directories** contain detailed chapter-by-chapter breakdowns

**Consistency Rules**:
- All story documents are in Markdown format
- Character names and terminology must remain consistent across all files
- When conflicts arise between documents, 大纲.md takes precedence
- New personality additions should immediately update both 人格图鉴.md and 伏笔追踪表.md
- Timeline discrepancies should be resolved using the outline's chapter structure

## Key Story Mechanics

**Personality System**: 
- Core personalities: #1 (Yandere), #2 (Foodie), #7 (Mathematician), #21 (Child), #35 (Lawyer), #42 (Answer Keeper)
- Each personality represents a different "way of understanding the universe"
- Power scaling tied to cultivation realms with realistic multipliers (1.8x-8x max)
- Internal meeting space allows personalities to collaborate in accelerated time

**Plot Structure**:
- 5 volumes of 20 chapters each (100 chapters total)
- Quantum mechanics integrated with cultivation world logic
- Philosophical themes around identity, choice, and observer effect
- Multiple antagonist factions with different ideologies

## Development Notes

This is a pure creative writing project with no executable code. When working with these files, focus on:
- Maintaining narrative consistency across all setting documents
- Preserving distinct character voices for each personality
- Tracking plot threads and foreshadowing elements using 伏笔追踪表.md
- Ensuring philosophical themes remain coherent throughout the story
- Balancing humor with deeper existential questions
- you should always use chinese in the main text,
- update character lists as story develops
- you need to control each chapter to above 2000 chars
- 注意剧情节奏，在章节之间保留适当悬念，提起读者阅读欲望

### Chapter Title Guidelines:
  - Avoid repetitive "XX的XX" (XX's XX) format
  - Use varied, concise titles that capture the essence
  - Examples of good formats:
    - Simple nouns: "观心镜" (Observation Mirror)
    - Emotional states: "温暖日常" (Warm Daily Life)
    - Single concepts: "监视" (Surveillance)
    - Action words: "融合"、"觉醒"、"突破"
    - Suspenseful: "真相"、"选择"、"代价"
