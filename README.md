# 修仙之后我和我们玩得很愉快

这是一个实验性质的项目，我尝试使用Claude AI完成小说创作。基本上repo内所有内容都来自AI：

1. 使用 claude app 生成了一些创意  [对话](脑洞/original-dialogue.md)
2. 使用 claude add 的 project 功能完成了大纲和一些设定，但是发现单独的 project 似乎并不足以完成整个任务，对话受到上下文的限制并且不方便修改。[对话](https://claude.ai/share/ba5b2f5a-acd2-4990-835b-d6a4ac7b17b1)
3. 使用 claude code 并使用 git 来管理文档。
4. 每次生成新章节，我会review并要求修改一些剧情上的问题，然后使用 [comprehensive-story-checker](.claude/agents/comprehensive-story-checker.md) 进行综合质量检查，包括：设定合规性、人物真实性、叙事连贯性验证以及文风和幽默元素的平衡调整。

大部分正文内容都使用 Sonnet4 生成，大纲和设定部分使用 Opus4.1生成。

本文在[起点连载](https://www.qidian.com/book/1046179946/)，同时也是测试有没有人能看出来这是AI写的（不过没人看就是了）。

An AI-driven Chinese light novel project featuring quantum superposition mechanics and cultivation world-building.

## 🤖 AI-Driven Creation

This story is created through collaboration between human creativity and AI assistance, utilizing advanced language models to develop complex narrative structures, character systems, and world-building elements.

## 📖 Story Overview

**Genre**: Chinese Light Novel / Xianxia with Science Fiction Elements

**Core Concept**: Lin Wanwan, a medical student, transmigrates into a cultivation world and develops the ability to manifest multiple personalities through quantum superposition states. She can summon up to 42 different versions of herself from parallel realities, each with unique abilities and characteristics.

### Key Elements

- **Quantum Mechanics meets Cultivation**: Scientific principles integrated with traditional xianxia world-building
- **Multi-Dimensional Personality System**: 42 distinct personalities based on quantum superposition theory
- **Medical Knowledge Integration**: Modern medical expertise applied in a cultivation world setting
- **Philosophical Themes**: Exploration of identity, choice, and the nature of existence

2. **Character Authenticity**: Each personality maintains distinct voice and behavioral patterns
3. **Balanced Tone**: Combines humor with philosophical depth
4. **Progressive Revelation**: Mysteries unfold naturally without forced exposition
5. **Scientific Integration**: Modern knowledge enhances rather than breaks fantasy immersion

## 🚀 Current Status

**Active Development**: Part 1 (Chapters 1-20) in progress

**Completed Elements**:
- Core world-building and personality system
- Character relationship frameworks  
- Power progression mechanics
- Foreshadowing infrastructure

**Next Milestones**:
- Complete Part 1 story arc
- Develop Part 2 detailed outline

- **Narrative Coherence**: Scene transitions and plot logic validation

## 📚 Reading Order

1. Start with `设定/大纲.md` for world overview
2. Read `设定/人格图鉴.md` for character system understanding
3. Follow chapters sequentially: `Part1/ch01.md` → `Part1/ch02.md` → ...
4. Reference `设定/伏笔追踪表.md` for plot thread analysis
